    "# Introduction to NumPy: The Foundation for Efficient Array Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is a powerful Python package that serves as the fundamental building block for a wide range of scientific computing and data analysis tasks. Its name stands for \"Numerical Python,\" reflecting its ability to efficiently handle numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, NumPy provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, ndarray, which enables you to store and manipulate large amounts of homogeneous data efficiently. This array data structure is essential for many other popular Python packages used in data science and machine learning, such as pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key advantages of NumPy lies in its efficient implementation. The underlying array operations are written in C, making them considerably faster than equivalent operations implemented in pure Python. This performance boost is crucial when dealing with large datasets, complex mathematical computations, or time-sensitive applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "A central concept in NumPy is the ability to vectorize operations, which allows you to perform mathematical operations on entire arrays rather than iterating through each element individually. By leveraging this feature, you can write concise and expressive code, often eliminating the need for explicit loops. This not only simplifies the code but also significantly improves execution speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy offers a comprehensive suite of functions for mathematical operations, random number generation, linear algebra, Fourier transformations, and more. Additionally, it provides tools for reading and writing array data to disk, enabling seamless integration with various file formats.\n",

    "In this practical course, we will delve into the essential functionalities of NumPy, exploring its powerful array manipulation capabilities, mathematical functions, and data analysis techniques. By the end of the course, you will have a solid foundation in NumPy, allowing you to efficiently work with numerical data and pave the way for advanced data science tasks.\n",

    "NumPy, the numerical computing package for Python, offers a rich set of objects and data types that are essential for efficient array manipulation and scientific computing. Let's take a brief look at some of the key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ndarray (N-dimensional Array):** The `ndarray` is the fundamental object in NumPy, providing a powerful data structure to represent homogeneous, multi-dimensional arrays. It enables efficient storage and manipulation of numerical data, supporting various mathematical and logical operations. With NumPy's ndarray, you can effortlessly handle large datasets and perform vectorized computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scalars:** NumPy introduces scalar data types that extend beyond Python's built-in types. These include integers (`int`), floating-point numbers (`float`), complex numbers (`complex`), and boolean values (`bool`). NumPy's scalars offer increased precision and optimized memory utilization compared to the standard Python equivalents.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Type Objects (dtype):** NumPy introduces its own data type objects, allowing you to define the precise characteristics of elements within arrays. These dtype objects specify the size, byte order, and data format of the elements. By utilizing specific dtypes, you can ensure the desired level of precision and control over memory allocation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Structured Arrays:** NumPy provides the ability to create structured arrays, where each element can be a composite of multiple fields or attributes. This feature is particularly useful when working with structured data, such as CSV files, where elements may have different data types and sizes. Structured arrays enable efficient handling of heterogeneous data in a tabular format.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Universal Functions (ufuncs):** NumPy's ufuncs are functions that operate element-wise on ndarrays, enabling efficient and fast mathematical operations. These functions are highly optimized and implemented in compiled C code, providing significant performance advantages over equivalent Python loops. Ufuncs cover a wide range of mathematical operations, including arithmetic, trigonometry, exponential functions, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy's rich collection of objects and data types forms the backbone of scientific computing in Python. By leveraging these powerful tools, you can efficiently work with arrays, perform complex calculations, handle structured data, and manipulate numerical data with ease.\n",

    "Write your own univariate linear model class. It should have two methods: a `fit` method that allows you to fit your model given some X and y (it should update the attributes `a` and `b`) and a predict method in which you can use the trained model to predict new y given X. Create an instance of the class, fit it with `square_meters`, `price` data and predict the  price for the following houses:"
